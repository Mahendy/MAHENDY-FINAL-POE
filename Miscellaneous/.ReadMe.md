Styling Approach

External Stylesheet: All pages use 'style.css'.
Base Styling: Reset applied for cross-browser consistency. Typography and colour palette defined globally.
Layout: CSS Flexbox and Grid used for navigation menus, cards, and content structure.
Typography: Relative units ('rem','em') applied for scalable fonts.
Responsive Design:

Desktop → Multi-column layout with sidebars.
Tablet → Adjusted spacing and reduced columns.
Mobile → Single-column stacking with simplified navigation.
Interactive Elements: Hover, focus, and active states added to buttons and links.



Responsive Design Testing

Screenshots were taken to verify that the website adjusts correctly across multiple devices:

Desktop View (≥1200px0)
Tablet View (~768px)
Mobile View (≤480px)

README – Green Valley EchoTech Waste Solutions Website

Project Overview

This project is a responsive, multi-page website for *Green Valley EchoTech Waste Solutions*, developed as part of my POE. The website includes full UI/UX design, interactive JavaScript components, SEO optimisation, and an updated layout based on the lecturer’s Part 2 feedback.



Updates Implemented Based on Part 2 Feedback

1. Fixed CSS Styling for Desktop

* Corrected inconsistent image layout on the *Services* page.
* Services page images were previously floating into the navigation area — fixed with proper grid/flex alignment.
* Ensured consistent spacing, alignment, and wrapping on all desktop resolutions.

2. Implemented Pseudo-Selectors/Classes

Used CSS pseudo-classes such as:

* `:hover`
* `:active`
* `:focus`
* `::before`
* `::after`
  Applied to:
  ✔ Buttons
  ✔ Navigation links
  ✔ Cards & service items
  ✔ Form input fields

This improves UI feedback and accessibility.

3. Fixed Header Issue on Services Page (Mobile)

* Removed CSS code displaying as *plain text* in the header.
* The issue was caused by an unclosed CSS comment.
* Cleaned and reorganized mobile CSS rules for all pages.

4. Fixed Hamburger Navigation (Now Works on All Pages)

* The hamburger menu only worked on the home page due to a missing JavaScript link on other pages.
* Added the script to all pages:

  ```html
  <script src="js/menu.js"></script>
  ```
* Updated query selectors to target navigation elements site-wide.
* Fully tested on all breakpoints (320px → 1440px).

5. Added Full Commit History to GitHub

* Implemented proper version control with multiple commits including:

  * `initial project setup`
  * `added css and layout updates`
  * `hamburger fix`
  * `part 2 fixes implemented`
  * `added readme and documentation`
